# Stock Market Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Steve wants to expand and do a little more research for his parents. Instead of analyzing several stocks, he wants to be able to easily analyze thousands of stocks across the entire stock market over the past few years. The ultimate purpose of this challenge will be to refactor/edit the existing code we used for module 2 to determine whether the VBA script will execute faster or not as a result. 
## Results
### Stock Performance 2017
### Stock Performance 2018
### Execution Time Original Script
### Execution Time Refactored Script

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
Some advantages include more logical, clear, and succinct code by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. It also is a good way to find bugs in the code and improve the design of the software. Some disadvantages may be that it can be time consuming and if it isn't documented well with comments for future coders, then it can be difficult to follow and edit properly.

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
It definitely helped the transition to refactoring the original VBA script by having documented and commented/labeled the various sections of code. When it came to refactoring, I could easily reference the comments and headings for guidance and to keep the script more organized and succinct. It was a bit time consuming and I found myself re-reading the refactored code repeatedly to ensure there were no mistakes and that each line of code made complete sense to both me and future coders.
